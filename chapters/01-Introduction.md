This is a course in the foundations of computational linguistics.

# Goals

Most courses taught on computational linguistics or natural language processing tend to be fairly advanced *survey* courses, assuming a large amount of knowledge of computer science and covering a variety of somewhat unrelated modeling techniques, problem domains, or tasks. This course takes a different approach, seeking to build up a small set of conceptual tools and empirical methods from ground up.

Some specific goals of the course include:

* Learning several of the foundational conceptual tools needed to understand computational models of linguistic structure.
* Understand the notion of a model of computation and how it can be applied to understand (aspects of) linguistic structure.
* Understand how to develop empirical evaluations of such models Learn how to read the literature
* Learn a bunch of specific, useful skills such as programming in ClojureScript.

# Content
Theory of computation
Information theory
Generative Linguistics
Chomsky Hierarchy

Organized around Chomsky hierarchy

Four dimensions of structure Content

How do we formalize a computational theory
How do we equip it with an evaluation metric
How do we develop algorithms that can use these two facets
How do we evaluate the resulting systems -->

# What this course is not

* A survey of current approaches in NLP
* A course about some specific software (e.g., Python libraries)
* A course that expects a lot of background knowledge (we will try to build everything up from  first concepts)

What you need: curiosity, ambition, fearlessness, and ability to use Google to find answers to technical problems.

# Programming

We will use Clojure, a LISP based on the $$\lambda$$-calculus. Clojure has several advantages.

* It is functional
* It is  simple to learn, but powerful.
* It is increasingly important (especially thanks to ClojureScript).
* LISP and the $$\lambda$$-calculus are used all over linguistics and AI.
* It allows metalinguistic abstraction.

# Resources

General LISP learning resources:

* [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) &mdash; this is for MIT Scheme, but still one of the best programming books ever written.
*  [SICP in Clojure](http://www.sicpdistilled.com/)
* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
* [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/)

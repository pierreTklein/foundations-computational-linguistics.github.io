CPS:
- get external function call business straightened out?

Inference:
- implement the particle cascade just to see how it works.
- benchmark against webchurch, maybe do some profiling
- clean up and simplify codebase â€” split ERPs and inference fns into own files.
- automating some of the factor splitting, moving, inserting stuff?
- try beam search

Integration:
- fix crazy box dependencies in lecture notes!
- script tag compilation / execution
- church to webppl compiler (based on webchurch or sweet macros)
- write test runner that checks that all boxes run independently

Ideas and examples:
- incremental speaker where word string is constructed with heuristic factor:
     factor( mean(map(completions(uttSoFar), function(c){return literalListener(c).score(world)})))
- cooler vision example
- idioms or constructs for managing heuristic factors (so that they will cancel eventually).
- learning the best heuristic factors.

- smart pages examples:
  - cap 






8/25:

- title
- format
- move to non-esslli permanent repos
- check all boxes for running / dependency
[- later: read through for sanity / terseness]

- benchmark various algorithms / against webchurch..
